This is a simple Data Science project made for the discipline 'TÃ³picos Especiais de Marketing' for Business Administration at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS).

It consisted in learning some topics on the way and applying them to the project, for example: database's analysis and auto-ML. 

The theme of the project was to figure it out how many public bonds would be bought in reais (R$ - brazilian currency).

There is a lot to do, still, but it's a way to enter in the world of Data Science.
